# 🎙️ Murf AI Voice Agent – Day 9  
**E-commerce Voice Agent**

This repository contains my submission for **Day 9** of the Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge.  
For this task, I built a voice-based **E-commerce Shopping Agent** featuring **Ramu Kaka**, a warm neighborhood-style shopkeeper persona for *Dr Jayraj Shop*.  
The agent enables customers to browse products, manage their cart, and place orders entirely through natural voice conversation.

- Integrated a product catalog (mugs, tees, hoodies, raincoats, laptops, mobiles)  
- Designed a clear, TTS-friendly voice interaction flow  
- Implemented tools to show catalog, add to cart, view cart, clear cart, place orders, and review past orders  
- Crafted the **Ramu Kaka** persona to bring warmth, humor, and continuity to the shopping experience  

## 📌 Tech Stack

## 📌 Current Status

## 🔧 Coming Soon
